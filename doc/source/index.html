<p class="intro">Pywebgen is a toolkit that helps you generate and manage a static
  website.</p>

<p class="intro">A static website is composed only of plain HTML pages
  and data, with no dynamic parts. It's a site that the web server can
  serve without thinking about it.</p>

<p>The problem with static websites is that there is often a lot of
  boilerplate: page headers, footers, menu bars... The usual solution
  to this involves copying and pasting the boilerplate between files,
  or switching to dynamic pages just for trivial "include this file"
  functionality.</p>

<p>Pywebgen solves this problem by letting you create your website as
  a set of template files, and then generating the actual site from
  these templates. This lets you write your boilerplate only once,
  like with dynamic languages, but still produces a completely static
  website that is very friendly to serve.</p>

<p>While I believe that pywebgen is quite easy to use, please note
  that it was developped with the "power user" in mind. It's not a
  Frontpage Express, and given its young age, it may require a little
  bit of tweaking to get working properly.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>

<ul>
  <li><em>Generation of HTML pages</em>
  from <a href="http://jinja.pocoo.org/2/">Jinja2</a> templates.</li>
  <li><em>Generation of CSS stylesheets</em> from a small
  custom <a href="http://www.yaml.org">YAML</a>-like language</li>
  <li><em>Simple versionning support</em>: a new version of the site
  that you generate doesn't become the "live" version until you decide
  to make it so.</li>
  <li><em>Deployment support</em>: you can deploy your static website into a
  directory containing other data, and later undeploy it without
  touching the other files in the directory.</li>
</ul>
