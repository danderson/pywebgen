<p class="intro">Pywebgen is a toolkit that helps you generate and manage a static
  website.</p>

<p class="intro">A static website is composed only of plain HTML pages and data,
  with no dynamic languages such as PHP, no CGI scripts, just plain
  files that the web server can serve without thinking about it.</p>

<p>The problem with static websites is that there is often a lot of
  boilerplate: page headers, footers, menu bars... Copying and pasting
  this boilerplate between files is very error-prone (as well as being
  aesthetically offensive), and you usually end up with pages that
  start slowly drifting apart, as small mutations start taking
  hold.</p>

<p>Pywebgen solves this problem by letting you create your website as
  a set of template files, and then generating the actual site from
  these templates. This lets you write your boilerplate once, and
  refer to it cleanly from all your pages.</p>

<p>Pywebgen also offers some basic versionning support: after hacking
  around with a new iteration of your website, you can instruct
  pywebgen to generate a new version of your site, check this version
  to make sure it looks right, and then give the order to deploy it as
  the new "production" version of the site. This distinction between
  generated versions and the version that is actually live lets you
  develop and experiment in peace, without fear that you'll suddenly
  break your site for all your visitors.</p>

<p>Blah, blah, blah... I really suck at selling stuff.</p>
